**Title:** Help Me Enhance My Wix Website for a Superior User Experience

**Body:**
Hi ChatGPT,

I’m currently working on developing a Wix website for a podcast called "Enneagram and Beyond." My goal is to create an engaging and informative platform where visitors can easily access podcast episodes, interact through comments, and explore resources related to personality development.

Here’s an overview of where the project stands and the improvements I’m looking to make:

1. **Website Objectives:**
   - Streamline the user experience with intuitive and easy-to-navigate design.
   - Provide seamless access to podcast episodes and relevant resources.
   - Incorporate features that encourage user engagement, like blogs, forums, and feedback forms.

2. **Current Setup:**
   - The site is live with basic pages set up (Home, About, Episodes, Contact).
   - It’s functional but lacks some key features, particularly in user interaction and content management.

3. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Design and Navigation:** How can I enhance the design to make navigation more intuitive and user-friendly?
   - **Content Management:** I’m considering how to best manage podcast episodes and blog posts. What are the best practices within Wix for content management?
   - **User Interaction:** I’d like to add features like user comments, forums, and polls. What are the best tools or methods for doing this in Wix?
   - **Performance Optimization:** Tips for ensuring the site loads quickly and performs smoothly would be appreciated.
   - **SEO and Marketing:** What are some effective strategies for improving SEO and promoting the site through Wix?

4. **Specific Questions:**
   - What are the best apps or features in Wix to enhance user interaction and overall site functionality?
   - Are there recommended templates or third-party integrations that work well for podcasting sites on Wix?
   - How can I optimize the site for SEO within the Wix platform?

I’m looking forward to your advice and suggestions on how I can make this website a comprehensive and user-friendly hub for our podcast listeners. Thanks in advance for your help!
